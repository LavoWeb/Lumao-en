      <description>Akeneo is a Product Information Management. With this tool, you can manage product collections very easily. For all formats, be it web, print, ERP data &amp;hellip;
The principle is that the PIM contains all the information of the products and is the master of the information. It is often coupled with a Data Asset Management which stores the media (photos, videos, music &amp;hellip;).
Akeneo is developed in Symfony 2 and is based on Oro Platform, a robust and actively developed framework.</description>
